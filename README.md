# Kuro
Kuro is a robot designed to help people in elderly care homes feel less lonely.

# Kuro 

Kuro is a little robot I made in the second semester of year 3 that aims to tackle loneliness in elderly care homes.
All code is provided as is and is not getting an update for the forseeable future.


# Hardware
I put the client sided code on a Raspberry Pi 4B when making Kuro and I recommend using this hardware or a more advanced Raspberry pi (if those exist by the time you read this) as long as there are 4 available usb slots, a headphone jack and enough pins on the board to be able to attach an RFID scanner.

# Testing the workflow:
In order to test this code for yourself, please make sure to do the following:
- Attach a USB microphone, speaker using aux cord and an RFID reader (specifically an RC522 RFID reader) to your pi.
- Install all libraries (both on the client and server end) needed to run the source code.
- Make sure to host a back-end server for the back-end and fill in the correct.
